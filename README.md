My goal is to write the code necessary to convert saves between
all consoles and all versions. It will also be able to handle
player conversion, and be usable in such a way to be easily scriptable
for editing blocks / nbt.

**The code exists to read from:**
1. WiiU
2. PS3
3. RPCS3 (Emulator)
4. ~~Xbox360 (.dat)~~
5. PSVita
6. Switch (region/entity conversion imminent)
7. PS4 (region/entity conversion imminent)

**The code exists to write to:**
1. WiiU
2. PSVita
3. PS3 (METADATA not yet resignable)
4. RPCS3 (METADATA not yet resignable)

I will update this README with more info as I go.

Be sure to check LICENSE.md for instructions on how this code may be used.
