My goal is to write the code necessary to convert saves between
all consoles and all versions. It will also be able to handle
player conversion, and be usable in such a way to be easily scriptable
for editing blocks / nbt.

**The code exists to read from:**
1. WiiU
2. Ps3 (compressed)
3. Ps3 (decompressed)
4. Xbox360 (.dat)
5. Vita
6. Switch (Everything but regions)
7. ~~Xbox360 (.bin)~~

**The code exists to write to:**
1. WiiU
2. PsVita (Untested)
3. RPCS3 (METADATA not resignable yet)

I will update this README with more info when I am not tired.

Be sure to check LICENSE.md for instructions on how this code may be used.
