My goal is to write the code necessary to convert saves between
all consoles and all versions. It will also be able to handle
player conversion, and be usable in such a way to be easily scriptable
for editing blocks / nbt.

The code exists to read from:
1. WiiU
2. Ps3
3. Xbox360
4. Vita
5. Switch (Everything but regions)

The code exists to write to:
1. WiiU
2. PsVita (Untested)

I will update this README with more info when I am not tired.

Be sure to check LICENSE.md for instructions on how this code may be used.
